# NeoVim configs

I put my NeoVim config files in `~/.config/nvim/`, which includes:

- `init.vim`: The init config file, contains plugins, basic settings, as well as loading other scripts inside this directory.
- `scripts/...`: Other configs, such as keymaps.
- `plugged/...`: Managed my [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug), contains all plugins.
- `plugConfs/...`: Contains the configurations for all the plugins.

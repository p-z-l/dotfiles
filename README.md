My personal config files for Linux-like systems

**Something you should know about my zsh configuration files**
I put my zsh configuration files in 3 places:
***`~/.zshrc`*** This is the zsh config file
***`~/.oh-my-zsh`*** This is the oh-my-zsh config dir
***`~/.config/zsh-custom`*** This is where I store my aliases, plugins, and other scripts

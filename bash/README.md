# Bash configs

I put my bash configs into several places:
1. `~/.bash_profile`: The initial config file
2. `~/.config/bash/`: A directory where I store other config files

Previously I was using Zsh as my default shell, I put a lot of plugins to make it look fancy.
While my previous Zsh configs have a lot of fancy powerful functions,
it's performance is not very ideal. And now I decided to go with a minimal config.
